    bio: 'Inspired by her love for dimsum, she decided to pursue a culinary career so she can make her own dimsum with a twist. A little backstory - growing up eating dimsum every weekend with her family, Emon developed a love and might she say, an addiction, to dimsum. Food is a way to bring people together for any occasion. When you dimsum, you winsum!'},

    {name: 'Patrick',
    position: 'Host',
    bio: 'Despite serving movie theater popcorn being the closest he\'s come to food service, Patrick has overcome both a lack of ability and an abrasive personality in order to become nationally recognized as the warmest host in south Brooklyn. He greets every customer as they enter our fine establishment and has a knack for remembering names. If you dine with us more than twice, we guarantee Patrick will remember you - if not, each member of your party will receive a free pork bun or veggie substitute (this will be docked from Patrick\'s pay).'}
